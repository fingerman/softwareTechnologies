## DEMO BLOG
================

A simple demo blog running on 5 - *FIVE* - different technologies and actually five different programming languages.   
Basically you have 5 blogs with absolutely the same Frontend but different Backend architecture in terms of language and framework.  
So we have:  
* [PHP with Symfony 3.4](https://github.com/fingerman/softwareTechnologies/tree/master/php-mvc-symfony/blog-symfony)
* [JS with NodeJS](https://github.com/fingerman/softwareTechnologies/tree/master/express/blog-nodejs) 
* Java with Spring //TODO
* C# with ASP.Net //TODO  
* Python with Django //TODO
