## DEMO BLOG
================

A simple demo blog running on 5 - *FIVE* - different technologies and actually five different programming languages.   
Basically you have 5 blogs with absolutely the same Frontend but different Backend architecture in terms of language and framework.  
So we have:  
* PHP with Symfony
* JS with Node //TODO
* Java with Spring //TODO
* C# with ASP.Net //TODO  
* Python with Django //TODO

Start with the repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fingerman/softwareTechnologies.git
```
PHP Symfony Demo Blog:
```
$ cd php-mvc-symfony/blog-symfony/
$ composer install
```
Edit your ```app/config/parameters.yml``` folder
